  <!-- About One Piece -->
  <section id="About One Piece" class="content"><h1>About One Piece</h1> <p>One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled in 108 tankōbon volumes as of March 2024. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.

    The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film by Production I.G, and an anime series by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one original video animation, and thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004 before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.
    
    One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, world-building, art, characterization, and humor. It has received many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. By December 2023, it had over 523.2 million copies in circulation in 61 countries and regions worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in book volume. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its over 100 published tankōbon volumes. One Piece is the only manga whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.</p></section>

  <!-- Straw Hat Pirates -->
  <section id="Straw Hat Pirates" class="content"><h1>Straw Hat Pirates</h1><p>The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew, or simply the Straw Hats, are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue.

    The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by "Red-Haired" Shanks and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom. The crew sailed on the Going Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship, which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the members fought over different names.
    
    Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, all the members were separated from one another by Bartholomew Kuma, a then-Warlord of the Sea and undercover agent of the Revolutionary Army. For two years, they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the sake of helping each other. They then reunited and have since continued to be a dynamic force in the New World, greatly disrupting the balance of the Three Great Powers. After the Raid on Onigashima, with the defeats of Kaidou and Big Mom, their captain officially became one of the new Four Emperors.</p></section>

  <!-- Devil Fruits -->
  <section id="Devil Fruits" class="content" ><h1>Devil Fruits</h1><p>Devil Fruits are a major plot device in One Piece. They are mysterious, supernatural fruits that are scattered throughout the world, though they are mostly seen within the Grand Line, and can grant special powers to anyone who eats them, ranging from the simplest abilities to highly destructive ones, and even the incredibly bizarre. As a price for consuming a Devil Fruit, the individual permanently becomes weak to seawater, essentially losing the ability to swim at all. There is no known way to remove the power or weaknesses, but once a user dies, the power will be reborn into another fruit waiting to be consumed by someone else. In addition, an individual can only acquire the power of a single Devil Fruit and survive, with only one notable exception for unspecified reasons. Their exact origin is a mystery, but they have existed for at least 800 years.

    All Devil Fruits are broadly grouped into three separate types based on what kind of powers they grant: Paramecia, which grant a wide variety of strange superhuman abilities, which, in general, do not fit into either of the other two types; Zoan, which allows a user to transform into a specific animal as well as an animal hybrid, including prehistoric and even mythological ones; and Logia, which grants a user the power to create, control, and transform their body into a natural element, and is widely considered the rarest and most powerful class of Devil Fruit. Each fruit is given a name based on what power it possesses, and can be identified by its appearance. Some fruits grant powers that are similar to others (some are even considered superior to another), but each and every one is unique to itself; in other words, no natural Devil Fruit has exactly the same power as another. Some fruits, however, grant abilities that are considered to be very unique to others of the same type. One fruit, in particular, has the honor of having two names while also fitting into two types.
    
    Devil Fruits are known to have empowered many of the world's most significant individuals, especially those among the Three Great Powers. This, along with their general rarity, causes them to be highly sought-after; single specimens may be valued at hundreds of millions in Belly, and extensive efforts have been made to mass-produce artificial versions for warfare. However, one does not need a Devil Fruit to become powerful, as there have been people who have garnered incredible fame and influence without ever having to eat one, such as the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger.</p></section>
